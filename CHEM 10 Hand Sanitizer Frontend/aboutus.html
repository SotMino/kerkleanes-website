        <p class="description">
          Kerkleanes is a 10th-grade student project of ACS Athens. The hand sanitizer is manufactured in SFA laboratory environments and has certified and compliant recipes based on European regulations. 
          Our hand sanitizer meets the WHO-standard ethanol-based composition of 96% ethanol, 3% hydrogen peroxide, 98% glycerol, and sterile boiled or distilled water. Production takes place with strict 
          enforcement of laboratory safety protocols like full PPE, ventilation, fire safety measures, and proper handling of chemicals. 
          All raw materials and finished goods undergo quality control as per ISO 22716:2007 cosmetic standards to ensure safety, efficacy, and potency. The solution is mixed in sanitary equipment, 
          filled in sterile 100 mL containers, and quarantined for 72 hours prior to use to destroy any potential spores. 
          Kerkleanes is more than an experiment in science, it's a team-effort, student-driven project with serious teams for manufacturing,
          safety, quality control, budgeting, legal adherence, branding, marketing, and web development. Every step of the way, from procurement of ingredients to labeling design and promotional planning, 
          is approached professionally and thoughtfully. Our aim is to offer high-quality, efficient, responsibly made hand sanitizer.
